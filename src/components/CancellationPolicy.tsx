          We understand that life is unpredictable, and you may occasionally need to reschedule or cancel an appointment. To help us manage our schedule and support all clients fairly, we kindly ask that you follow our cancellation policy outlined below:

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-3">Notice Period & Fees</h2>

            <li><b>More than 48 hours' notice:</b> No cancellation fee.</li>
            <li><b>24â€“48 hours' notice:</b> 50% of the session fee will be charged.</li>
            <li><b>Less than 24 hours' notice or no-show:</b> The full session fee will be charged.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4 font-bold text-gray-800">
            Cancellation fees must be paid in full before the next session can proceed.

            SMS reminders are sent as a courtesy only. Failure to receive a reminder (e.g., due to technical issues or incorrect contact details) does not waive cancellation fees.

            We reserve the right to reschedule appointments in the event of staff illness, office closure, or unforeseen emergencies. If this occurs, we will contact you as soon as possible to arrange an alternative time.
